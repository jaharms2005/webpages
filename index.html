    <p>The planet I have chosen to write about is <em>Neptune</em>. Neptune is the 8th outermost planet from the Sun, it is also the 3rd <strong>largest</strong> planet in our solar system. One interesting fact about Neptune is that it is the only planet that can not be seen by the naked eye. Neptune has a very long orbit which is <ins>164.8 Earth years</ins>, it recently completed its first orbit since being discovered. Neptune has 14 moons, and it also has rings surrounding the planet which were very difficult to discover.

    Newton's thought experiment for getting into orbit is also known as <em>“Newton's cannonball.”</em> The main concept from Newton's thought experiment was that if a projectile is launched fast enough, then it will travel far enough that the curvature of the Earth would fall beneath it. This would result in an <strong>orbit</strong> instead of the object falling straight down. <ins>Periapsis</ins> is the closest point in an elliptical orbit, while <ins>apoapsis</ins> is the farthest point in an elliptical orbit.
